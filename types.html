                        <p class="type-subtitle">Also known as Weak AI</p>
                        <p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence represents AI systems designed to perform a single, specific task. These systems operate within a limited, predefined range of functions. Most AI applications we use today fall into this category, including virtual assistants like Siri, recommendation algorithms on Netflix, and spam filters in email systems. ANI excels at what it's programmed to do but cannot generalize beyond its specific domain.</p>

                        <h2>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h2>
                        <p class="type-subtitle">Also known as Strong AI</p>
                        <p>Artificial General Intelligence refers to AI systems with human-level cognitive abilities. These systems would be capable of understanding, learning, and applying knowledge across a wide range of tasks and domains, just like a human being. AGI can think, reason, and adapt to new situations autonomously. This level of AI does not yet exist but is the goal of major AI research organizations worldwide.</p>

                        <p class="yi-subtitle">Beyond Human Capabilities</p>
                        <p>Artificial Super Intelligence represents AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence. ASI would not only match but exceed the cognitive performance of humans in virtually every domain. This hypothetical form of AI raises important questions about control, ethics, and the future of humanity. Many experts believe ASI, if achieved, could either solve humanity's greatest challenges or pose unprecedented risks.</p>
