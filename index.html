                    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence? 🤖</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.</p>

                    <h2>How AI Started 🚀</h2>
                    <p>AI has its origins in ancient myths and stories about artificial beings endowed with intelligence. However, the field of AI as we know it today began in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and organized the first AI conference. Since then, AI has evolved from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning algorithms that power today's most advanced technologies.</p>
